## Lab 05

#### Summary
First assigment with linked lists.

#### Challenge Description
Problem domain was to create a method to instantiate a Linked List, a method to add into the Linked List, and a method to return a string including the values of the nodes in the Linked List. Also, tests needed to be created to verfiy the methods worked.

#### Approach & Efficiency
Through research and TA James assistance, I was able to work through problems I ran into while coding and learn more about Linking Lists.
