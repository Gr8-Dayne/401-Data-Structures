## Class 12 Code Challenge - First-in, First out Animal Shelter

#### Summary

I whiteboarded and solved this issue presented to me through research and inquiries to TA James and my fellow classmates.

#### Challenge Description

The feature task was listed as: Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.

* enqueue(animal)
* dequeue(pref)

## Class 11 Code Challenge - Queue with Stacks

#### Summary

I whiteboarded and solved this issue presented to me through research and inquiries to TA James and my fellow classmates.

#### Challenge Description

The feature task was listed as: Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

#### Approach & Efficiency

## Lab 10 - Stack and Queue Implementation

#### Summary

First assigment with Stacks and Queues.

#### Challenge Description

Create Stack class and Queue class that work.

#### Approach & Efficiency

Using testing and system out print lines, I created methods specifically tailored to the feature tasks of this lab.

## Class 8 Code Challenge - Merge Lists

#### Summary

I whiteboarded (on paper) and solved this issue presented to me through research and inquiries.

#### Challenge Description

The feature task was listed as: Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

#### Approach & Efficiency

I first sought out the assistance of my TA, James, who gave me great advice to go off of. after i had been working at it for a while, I browsed the internet looking for any useful pointers. After that, it was basically trial and error.

## Class 7 Code Challenge - kth value from the end of a linked list

#### Summary

I whiteboarded (on paper) and solved this issue presented to me through research and inquiries.

#### Challenge Description

The feature task was listed as: write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

#### Approach & Efficiency

Through research and dedication, I wrote out what I was going to do (whiteboard method) and I researched and asked quetions when needed.

## Lab 05

#### Summary
First assigment with linked lists.

#### Challenge Description
Problem domain was to create a method to instantiate a Linked List, a method to add into the Linked List, and a method to return a string including the values of the nodes in the Linked List. Also, tests needed to be created to verfiy the methods worked.

#### Approach & Efficiency
Through research and TA James assistance, I was able to work through problems I ran into while coding and learn more about Linking Lists.
