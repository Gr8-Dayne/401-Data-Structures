## Class 7 Code Challenge - kth value from the end of a linked list

#### Summary

I whiteboarded (on paper) and solved this issue presented to me through research and inquiries.

#### Challenge Description

The feature task was listed as: write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, k, as a parameter. Return the node’s value that is k from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

#### Approach & Efficiency

Through research and dedication, I wrote out what I was going to do (whiteboard method) and I researched and asked quetions when needed.

## Lab 05

#### Summary
First assigment with linked lists.

#### Challenge Description
Problem domain was to create a method to instantiate a Linked List, a method to add into the Linked List, and a method to return a string including the values of the nodes in the Linked List. Also, tests needed to be created to verfiy the methods worked.

#### Approach & Efficiency
Through research and TA James assistance, I was able to work through problems I ran into while coding and learn more about Linking Lists.
